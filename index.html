                    <ol>
                        <li class="inbox">An Optiplex running OPNSense.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">An unmanaged netgear switch for essential functions. (low power option)</li>
                        <li class="inbox">A manager Juniper Switch EX3300 for for additional devices.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">An unused desktop gaming PC which serves as my main compute.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">A dell poweredge which serves as additional compute when I don't have to worry about power consumption.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">Raspberry Pi running Pi-Hole and Tailscale. It is my tailscale exit node.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">My personal PC, which is where I manage everything from.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="inbox">I typically prefer the lower power options I have. The old desktop PC and the small switch are servicable while costing less for me to run. As I also live with roommates, this help's keep their power bill low too.</p>
                    <p class="inbox">The optiplex acts as the router in this network. It is then connected to the managed switch where I have my work computer, personal computer, main compute, and pi-hole also connected.</p>
                    <p class="inbox">Future upgrades: I would like to buy a dedicated PFSense box in the near future, as well as a Ubuquiti AP for better wireless speeds.</p>

                    <p class="inbox"><a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-hole</a> is a super popular and very easy to set up custom DNS server that blocks advertisements. This was my first "homelab" project that and it was a great starting point for me to learn about DNS, DHCP, and how networking works.</p>
                    <p class="inbox">Steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="inbox">Install RaspberryOS</li>
                        <li class="inbox">I literally just ran this: "curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash"</li>
                        <li class="inbox">I configured the server through the GUI. Setting passwords and adding blocklists.</li>
                        <li class="inbox">I then configured my router to use the Pi-hole for DNS queries.</li>
