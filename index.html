            <h2>My Homelab</h2>
            <p>This is my biggest cumlative project. Most of my other IT related projects will fall under this. My current hardware consists of:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>An Optiplex running OPNSense.</li>
                <li>An unmanaged netgear switch for essential functions. (low power option)</li>
                <li>A manager Juniper Switch EX3300 for for additional devices.</li>
                <li>An unused desktop gaming PC which serves as my main compute.</li>
                <li>A dell poweredge which serves as additional compute when I don't have to worry about power consumption.</li>
                <li>Raspberry Pi running Pi-Hole and Tailscale. It is my tailscale exit node.</li>
                <li>My personal PC, which is where I manage everything from.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I typically prefer the lower power options I have. The old desktop PC and the small switch are servicable while costing less for me to run. As I also live with roommates, this help's keep their power bill low too.</p>
            <p>The optiplex acts as the router in this network. It is then connected to the managed switch where I have my work computer, personal computer, main compute, and pi-hole also connected.</p>
            <p>Future upgrades: I would like to buy a dedicated PFSense box in the near future, as well as a Ubuquiti AP for better wireless speeds.</p>

            <h2>Pi-hole and Tailscale(RaspberryPi)</h2>
            <p>I'm grouping these into one section as they run on the same device, and were both deployed at a similar time.</p>
            <h3>Pi-hole</h3>
            <p><a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-hole</a> is a super popular and very easy to set up custom DNS server that blocks advertisements. This was my first "homelab" project that and it was a great starting point for me to learn about DNS, DHCP, and how networking works.</p>
            <p>Steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install RaspberryOS</li>
                <li>I literally just ran this: "curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash"</li>
                <li>I configured the server through the GUI. Setting passwords and adding blocklists.</li>
                <li>I then configured my router to use the Pi-hole for DNS queries.</li>
            </ol>
